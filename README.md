# MachineLearning-Project-2

## Introduction 

The data set of the world happiness scores, used in the 2016 world happiness report, was found to contain 4 important key features. Namely, ”economy”, ”family”, ”health” and ”freedom". In this project we will reinforce our analysis of the data set by applying 3 machine learning models to analyse to what degree we can train models to predict the outcome of a country yet to be rated. We will apply 3 models of regression and 3 of classification. The regression models should predict the Happiness Score, and the classification should predict the binary Happy attribute. For regression we will apply a Linear Regression-, Neural Network- and a baseline model. For classification we will apply a Logistic Regression-, Neural Network- and a baseline model.
Where we prior focused on 4 key attributes we will now take all 7 attributes into account. Furthermore, from prior analysis it was discovered that the happiness score was based on the summation of the other attributes. This leads us to hypothesise that a Linear Regression model will be highly efficient in predicting the happiness score based on the attributes. Therefore, we hope to accomplish a very good linear regression model, that can predict the happiness score from the different attributes.

## Usage

The "init.py" function loads a dataset and adds the binary attribute "Happy" used in classification. Run either "regression_part_2.py" or "classification_part_1.py" to get statistics and plots for the 3 machine learning models.
