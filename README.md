# MachineLearning-Project-2

## Introduction 

The data  set  of  the  world  happiness  scores,  used  in  the  2016  world  happiness  report,  was  found  to  contain4  important  key  features.   Namely,  ”economy”,  ”family”,  ”health”  and  ”freedom”.   In  this  project  we  willreinforce our analysis of the data set by applying 3 machine learning models to analyse to what degree we cantrain models to predict the outcome of a country yet to be rated.  We will apply 3 models of regression and 3 ofclassification.  The regression models should predict the Happiness Score, and the classification should predictthe binary Happy attribute.  For regression we will apply a Linear Regression-, Neural Network- and a baselinemodel.  For classification we will apply a Logistic Regression-, Neural Network- and a baseline model.  Wherewe prior focused on 4 key attributes we will now take all 7 attributes into account.  Furthermore, from prioranalysis it was discovered that the happiness score was based on the summation of the other attributes.  Thisleads us to hypothesise that a Linear Regression model will be highly efficient in predicting the happiness scorebased on the attributes.  Therefore, we hope to accomplish a very good linear regression model, that can predictthe happiness score from the different attributes.

## Usage

The "init.py" function loads a dataset and adds the binary attribute "Happy" used in classification. Run either "regression_part_2.py" or "classification_part_2.py" to get statistics and plots for the 3 machine learning models.
